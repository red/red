Running the Red hello script
------------------------

1. In a REBOL console, from the parent folder, type:

    `do/args %red.r "%red/tests/hello.red"`

The compilation process should finish with a `...output file size` message. The resulting binary is in the working folder. Windows users need to open a DOS console and run `hello.exe` from there.

2. To see the intermediary Red/System code generated by the compiler, use:

    `do/args %red.r "-v 1 %red/tests/hello.red"`


Command-line options:

    -d				Switches into debug mode.
    
    -o <file>		Outputs executable to given path and/or filename.
    
    -t <target>		Cross-compiles to another target (see home page for target list).
    
    -v <level>		Sets verbose mode. 1-3 are for Red only, above for Red/System.
    

*Important*: Red will be distributed as a binary to end users and the effect of:

    red script.red
    
will be to compile and run it from memory directly. So the -o option will become mandatory in the future for generating an executable without running it. During the bootstrapping stage, it is complex to support that feature, but it will be implementd as soon as possible.
